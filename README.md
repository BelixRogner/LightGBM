ExaBoost
========

A friendly, contribution-open fork of [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) for running gradient boosted decision trees at **exa-row scale** — billions of rows today, headed for trillions as storage catches up to ambition.

ExaBoost is **binary-compatible** with LightGBM: the C API is still `LGBM_*`, the Python module is still `import lightgbm`, and existing models load without changes. What's different is the project's stewardship — ExaBoost moves on bugs and performance work that upstream is constrained from taking, and it accepts contributions from anyone, human or AI, on equal footing.

> **Not affiliated with [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai).** Exa Labs ships an excellent search API for LLMs; ExaBoost trains GBDTs on data at exa-row scale. Different "exa", different product, no relationship.

What's different from upstream LightGBM
---------------------------------------

- **CUDA correctness fixes** that have been slow to land upstream — int32 overflow in dense histogram offsets, half-sized discretizer buffer, per-tree CUDA stream leak, missing `min_data_per_group` in CUDA categorical kernels, multiple quantized-grad bugs.
- **Per-tree feature-fraction compact view.** At `colsample_bytree = 0.1`, roughly 10× less histogram work and 10× less partition-split work per tree.
- **Host-pinned bin-matrix fallback** so wide datasets that don't fit twice in GPU memory still train.
- **Metal backend** (Apple silicon, M-series) — `device_type=metal` runs histogram construction on the integrated GPU. ~1.1–1.4× end-to-end training speedup on M4 Pro, bit-exact AUC vs CPU. Supports the standard binary / multiclass / regression / ranking objectives, quantized gradients (32-bit case), bagging, feature_fraction, categorical features, monotone constraints, early stopping, init_model, model save/load. See the [Metal section](#building-with-the-metal-backend-macos-apple-silicon) below.
- **Open contribution policy.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Human and AI contributors are welcome on the same terms.

Install / build
---------------

Until ExaBoost ships its own packages, build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BelixRogner/ExaBoost.git
cd ExaBoost
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
# Adjust CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES for your GPU. RTX 5090 = 120, RTX 4090 = 89.
cmake -DUSE_CUDA=1 -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="89-real;120-real;120-virtual" ..
cmake --build . --target _lightgbm -j 8
```

Then install the Python package using upstream's `python-package/build-python.sh --precompile`. The Python module imports as `lightgbm`.

### Building with the Metal backend (macOS, Apple silicon)

The Metal backend accelerates dense histogram construction on the integrated
GPU. M-series Macs only (Intel Macs not supported).

```bash
# One-time: vendor Apple's metal-cpp headers.
mkdir -p external_libs/metal-cpp
curl -sSL -o /tmp/metal-cpp.zip \
    "https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/files/metal-cpp_macOS15_iOS18.zip"
unzip -q /tmp/metal-cpp.zip -d /tmp/
mv /tmp/metal-cpp/{Foundation,Metal,MetalFX,QuartzCore,SingleHeader,LICENSE.txt,README.md} \
   external_libs/metal-cpp/

# Build.
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DUSE_METAL=ON ..
cmake --build . -j 8

# Install Python package (precompiled).
cd .. && sh ./build-python.sh install --precompile
```

Then use `device_type="metal"` in your training params:

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
params = {"objective": "binary", "device_type": "metal", "num_leaves": 63}
bst = lgb.train(params, dataset, num_boost_round=100)
```

**Eligibility** (datasets that get Metal acceleration; others transparently
fall back to CPU):
- Dense (non-multi-val) features
- ≤ 256 bins per feature
- ≥ 32 features (override via `LIGHTGBM_METAL_MIN_FEATURES=N`)
- `use_quantized_grad` is supported for 32-bit-histogram leaves (typically
  the root and early-depth leaves); 16-bit-histogram leaves fall back to CPU

The 16/64/256-bin kernel variants are compiled and selected automatically
based on each dataset's `max_bin`.

**Numerical parity:** Metal output matches CPU bit-exactly on the
[binary classification example](examples/binary_classification/) (AUC,
logloss). On larger datasets, atomic-ordering rounding can produce sub-ULP
drift; the parity tests in `tests/python_package_test/test_metal.py` assert
AUC / accuracy / F1 agreement within 2% absolute tolerance.

**Known edge case:** `min_data_in_leaf<=2` *combined with*
`min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=0` can trip a LightGBM `left_count > 0` check
during training because atomic-ordering noise in the Metal histogram's
bin hessian-sum can make the derived integer row-count round to 0 for
a nominally-tiny leaf. CPU isn't affected (deterministic histograms).
Workarounds: stick with the LightGBM defaults (`min_data_in_leaf=20`,
`min_sum_hessian_in_leaf=1e-3`), or use `device_type="cpu"` if you
really need extreme regularization settings.

**FAQ:**

- *Why isn't Metal running on my dataset?* Check the verbose log
  (`verbose=2`); look for `Metal: skipping acceleration (...)`. The
  message tells you why — usually narrow data (< 96 features),
  multi-val groups, > 256 bins, or `use_quantized_grad=true`.
- *Can I use Metal on Intel Macs?* No, the kernels rely on Apple-silicon
  features (atomic_uint in threadgroup memory, MSL 3.0 SIMD operations).
- *Does this affect inference?* No, prediction is CPU-only and unchanged.
- *Will my saved model load on a non-Metal build?* Yes, model files are
  device-agnostic — see `test_model_save_load_cross_device`.

**Test coverage:** 27 Python parity tests + 3 cpp gtests covering binary
classification, multiclass, regression, lambdarank, quantile regression,
categorical features, bagging, feature_fraction, L1/L2 regularization,
monotone constraints, multi-feature groups, early stopping, init_model
(continued training), cross-device model save/load, sparse-input +
quantized-gradient fallbacks, multi-model process, env-var overrides,
max_bin boundary, 1024-feature wide, and 100k-row drift stress. Run via
`LIGHTGBM_TEST_METAL=1 pytest tests/python_package_test/test_metal.py`.

**Environment variables:**
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_MIN_FEATURES=N` (default 96): below N features, Metal
  falls back to CPU (dispatch overhead exceeds the kernel win on narrow data).
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_WG_PER_FEAT=N` (default auto): override the workgroups-
  per-feature tiling. Auto-tunes to target ~512 threadgroups.
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_MIN_LEAF_ROWS=N` (default 0, opt-in): delegate
  ConstructHistograms to CPU when the current leaf has fewer than N rows.
  Useful for highly skewed trees where most rows end up in shallow leaves.
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_K_FEATS=2` (default 1, experimental): use the
  multi-feature kernel that processes 2 adjacent features per threadgroup
  with shared grad/hess reads. Benchmarks on M4 Pro show this is *not*
  net-faster, but it remains opt-in for future hardware experimentation.
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_OMP_WRITEBACK_THRESHOLD=N` (default 256): minimum
  num_features required to parallelize the per-feature write-back loop
  with OpenMP. Below the threshold the loop runs single-threaded.
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_TIMING=1`: print per-call timing breakdown at process
  exit (idx_copy / dispatch / gpu_only / writeback).
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_VERIFY=1`: differential mode. Runs CPU histograms
  alongside Metal, compares element-wise, logs drift > 10%, and uses
  CPU values for splits. ~2× slower; catches kernel regressions during
  development.
- `LIGHTGBM_METAL_FORCE_MULTI_VAL=1`: opt *in* to Metal acceleration for
  sparse-multi-val feature groups. Default skips them and falls back to
  CPU because CPU's sparse-optimized path is faster (Metal materializes
  the full dense column buffer, paying for the zeros). Output still
  matches CPU bit-exactly when forced on.
