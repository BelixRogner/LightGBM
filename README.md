ExaBoost
========

A friendly, contribution-open fork of [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) for running gradient boosted decision trees at **exa-row scale** — billions of rows today, headed for trillions as storage catches up to ambition.

ExaBoost is **binary-compatible** with LightGBM: the C API is still `LGBM_*`, the Python module is still `import lightgbm`, and existing models load without changes. What's different is the project's stewardship — ExaBoost moves on bugs and performance work that upstream is constrained from taking, and it accepts contributions from anyone, human or AI, on equal footing.

> **Not affiliated with [Exa.ai](https://exa.ai).** Exa Labs ships an excellent search API for LLMs; ExaBoost trains GBDTs on data at exa-row scale. Different "exa", different product, no relationship.

What's different from upstream LightGBM
---------------------------------------

- **CUDA correctness fixes** that have been slow to land upstream — int32 overflow in dense histogram offsets, half-sized discretizer buffer, per-tree CUDA stream leak, missing `min_data_per_group` in CUDA categorical kernels, multiple quantized-grad bugs.
- **Per-tree feature-fraction compact view.** At `colsample_bytree = 0.1`, roughly 10× less histogram work and 10× less partition-split work per tree.
- **Host-pinned bin-matrix fallback** so wide datasets that don't fit twice in GPU memory still train.
- **Open contribution policy.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Human and AI contributors are welcome on the same terms.

Install / build
---------------

Until ExaBoost ships its own packages, build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BelixRogner/ExaBoost.git
cd ExaBoost
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
# Adjust CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES for your GPU. RTX 5090 = 120, RTX 4090 = 89.
cmake -DUSE_CUDA=1 -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="89-real;120-real;120-virtual" ..
cmake --build . --target _lightgbm -j 8
```

Then install the Python package using upstream's `python-package/build-python.sh --precompile`. The Python module imports as `lightgbm`.

Documentation
-------------

API documentation is currently the upstream LightGBM docs at <https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/>. ExaBoost-specific deltas are described in this repo's per-PR descriptions and in [NUMERAI-CUDA-FORK.md](NUMERAI-CUDA-FORK.md). Project-specific documentation is on the roadmap.
